# Daily Reflection Journal 🧘‍♂📓

This is a beginner-friendly Python app that helps you reflect on your day before going to sleep.  
It asks a few simple, positive questions like:

- Who did you help today?
- Did you make someone smile?
- Did you drink enough water?
- What are you grateful for?

All your answers are saved in a daily file with the current date.
